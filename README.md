Using GitHub MCP Server with VS Code
    https://youtu.be/CVPG9aqVQ3s

Using the OhMyTasks solution, ask GitHub copilot to create a separate ASP.NET MVC project in the same solution. 

    The MVC project should duplicate the same functionality as the console application.
    The MVC project must persist data in a SQL Server database.
    The connection string to the database must be saved in the appsettings.Development.json

Show your instructor your solution next week.
